      <h1>Here are few things about me:</h1>
      <ul class="explanation">
        <li class="first-li">
          Here is how I look like in real life.
          <img
            class="portrait"
            src="/assets/mahdi.jpg"
            alt="My professional portrait"
          />
          I tend not to post photo online, but I realized that I need to make at
          least one professional photo that looks casual enough. I might take
          the photo in the future, but please bear with this for now.
        </li>
        <li class="second-li">
          What sparks my interest was generally that I spend my work in front of
          my laptop, and I got curious with programming although I only learn it
          casually. After talking with my friends who has more experience with
          programming, I decided to pursue new career path in software
          engineering. There is no concrete plan on what kind of technology I
          will master, as the basics are quite broad. However, I think I can fit
          with this as I find programming to be really interesting. Especially
          now that I learned things here with RevoU, my chances are getting
          bigger and I learned a lot.
        </li>
        <li class="third-li">
          I am majoring in food technology back in my university, spending most
          of my years in laboratory. I found similarities where I have to work
          carefully now, with differences that instead of glassware and
          machines, now it's codes. And punctuation marks.
        </li>
        <li class="fourth-li">
          I like playing PC games, and put lots of hours within it. I play
          competitive games mostly (DOTA 2, Overwatch 2), and sometimes RTS
          games like Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and Starcraft. I also
          play Genshin Impact, but for totally different reason.
        </li>
        <li class="fifth-li">
          I enjoy sports, but its only either jogging or badminton. I watch
          other ones too but these two are what I mainly do for sport.
