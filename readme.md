# WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT & CUSTOM DOMAIN USING PERSONAL WEBSITE

### Hello!

This readme file will be used to document whole process of deploying website using Netlify, creating a custom domain for our personal website, and connecting it through Cloudflare to add layer of protection for our website. For my custom domain, I will be using one from Niagahoster.

For this project, I will be using my own personal website that has been created for Week 1 project.

[Personal Website](https://mahdiharish.netlify.app/)

This is my personal website with URL using Netlify.

[Personal Website with Custom Domain]()

This is my personal website with custom domain URL.
